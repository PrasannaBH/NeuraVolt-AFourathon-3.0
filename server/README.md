This is step by step guid to build the Backend of the Cab Management App, If you follow this you can build backend for the app
 cab management application using the first approach, where MySQL is installed before Docker:

1. Set up an AWS EC2 instance:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to the EC2 service.
   - Launch a new EC2 instance, selecting the appropriate instance type and configuration.

2. Install MySQL on the EC2 instance:
   - Connect to the EC2 instance using SSH.
   - Install MySQL on the EC2 instance following the appropriate installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Set up the database:
   - Configure the MySQL database, including setting up the necessary credentials, creating a new database, and granting the required privileges.

4. Develop the backend API using Java and Spring Boot:
   - Set up a Java development environment on the EC2 instance.
   - Create a new Spring Boot project or clone an existing project to the EC2 instance.
   - Configure the application properties to establish a connection to the MySQL database.

5. Containerize the backend application:
   - Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project, specifying the necessary dependencies and build steps.
   - Build a Docker image of your backend application using the Dockerfile.
   - Push the Docker image to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Amazon ECR.

6. Set up environment variables and configuration:
   - Define environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information like database credentials.
   - Ensure that the environment variables or configuration files are properly loaded by the application.

7. Deploy the Docker container on the EC2 instance:
   - Pull the Docker image onto the EC2 instance from the container registry.
   - Run the Docker container, mapping the required ports and providing the necessary environment variables or configuration files.
   - Ensure that the Docker container can connect to the MySQL database on the EC2 instance.

8. Implement API endpoints for the frontend:
   - Design and implement the required API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the backend.
   - Use Spring Boot annotations to define RESTful endpoints and handle data retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion.

9. Test and debug:
   - Perform thorough testing of the backend API to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
   - Debug any issues or errors encountered during testing and make necessary fixes.

10. Monitor and maintain:
    - Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the performance and behavior of the backend application.
    - Regularly monitor the application's health and address any issues that arise.
    - Keep the backend application up to date with security patches and updates.

These steps provide a revised outline for creating the backend of your cab management application using AWS EC2, MySQL, Docker, and Spring Boot. Please make adjustments based on your specific project requirements and preferences.
